	Zoe Richter is currently funded by an NRC fellowship, and would like to thank Dr. Huff, 	Andrei Rykhlevskii, Roberto Fairhurst, and Sam Dotson of the ARFC team at UIUC.

	Acknowledgements should include both people who helped and funding 
        streams. If you are funded by an NEUP grant, that number usually goes 
        here. .
